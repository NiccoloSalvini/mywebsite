This is a personal customization of an existing theme from [Themefisher](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-hugo)
- The site is fully made in R and has a [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) static _HTML_ file generator
- I deployed it with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) importing the repo from the [Github](https://github.com/NiccoloSalvini) "mywebsite"
- Then in order to make it easy to edit and upload contents I exported the site into a flexible CMS [Forestr.io](https://forestry.io/)
