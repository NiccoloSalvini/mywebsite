#  Setup (Hugo + Netlify + Forestry)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d15a0d90-ecf5-4b08-a451-2175034ac135/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/niccolosalvini/deploys)

  
This is my customized theme from [Themefisher](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-hugo)

1. The site is fully made in R and has a [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) static _HTML_ file generator
1. I deployed the site through [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) importing my repo from the [**Github**](https://github.com/NiccoloSalvini) "mywebsite"
1. Then in order to make it easy to edit and upload contents I exported the site into a flexible _CMS_ [**Forestry.io**](https://forestry.io/)
