# Digital Footprint?

One of the main reason for me to have this is leaving a permanent footprint of my existence. People have been doing it since prehistoric era, and they kept doing since the internet got in the game. Someone likes to say "if you do not post it then you are not doing it". I am not part of that philosophy even tough we are leaving in a world that actually is this. I am more like [Athazagorafobic]().
