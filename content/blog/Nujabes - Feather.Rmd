Light as a feather
When I'm floatin through
Readin through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the golden rule

Centimetres of ether I'm heatin the speaker
Motivational teacher with words that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined with discord
It's either genocide, all the planet in uproar

Never good but rules of paradise are never nice
The best laid plan of mice and men are never right
I'm just a vagabond with flowers for algernon
The average joe who knows what the fuck is goin on
It's the hope of my thoughts that i travelled upon
Fly like an arrow of god until I'm gone

So I'm driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater

So I'm driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
Taking chances
Word tap dancing with wolves
In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of arizona
The sun be high, life's ironic


Aint tryin to be talib when I write
Surreal life I paint it vivid habitat crazy insane
Watch the propaganda 6 o'clock news that are saying
Cultures clash for black folk and white trash
They revel in the cyberspace that might crash
Dash to millineum a million miles of runnin

N at the speed of now back don't return gunnin
Rambo style gunho child gunnin
Ammo blao two times loud stunnin
Stunnin when I hit ya lift you off the earth like


Ayo take you right back to birth
And niggaz wonder why they might wonder why
This shit might happen but it does, they go

Driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So i'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater

So I'm driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater

Treat you better than me
Because that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength
Where my essence will be
It's the knowledge of self

Understanding of the things around me
That becomes the wisdom that I need
Living this life to the best of my ability
Channelling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
Remember me because my clothes remain gold

I got the gift of gab like them pimps in kangols
It never ends I keep it rulin like a cypher
The first caveman bringin fire
Innovating and higher to blast mistakes I raise the stakes

It's double or nothing in this vaccuum-less space
I will survive,
Divine the time to cry fuck a hold or hide i'm alive with pride
And I drove the chevy to the levy
But the levy was dry singin "this will be the day that I die
