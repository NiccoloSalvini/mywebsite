# I had this idea


So here what is up: my father has this problem, he has implemented all his stuff (he is a
business consultant ) on the excel, which is **good** and **intuitive** but also time consuming.
He has to switch from tab to tab to change values and to evaluate if the financial operation he is verifing is well done. He can possibily perform some data visualisation but its tools are not dynamic and they are not good looking. Since his work is to demonstrate in trials that he is right I guessed that the most important part was communication. Communication has always been a key to business, but nowadays it is becoming more and more important due to the high level of specilisation in work. Besides my personal point of view on communication if the idea is to convince your stakeholder to take your part you should be putting stuff as much clear as possibile to make your assumption undestandable, especially if your stakeholder is a judge aka legal people. Evreybody knows that judges are well educated people but they are not in finance and economics, maybe they are but for sure not in mathematics, So everytime you telling them stuff they know more or less how it the stuff is working but they cant really undestand what is going on. This good knoledge gap is justifiedn by the fact that judges can name up a CTU (consulente tecnico di parte) to evaluate the issue. I do no want to go any further in the trial iter.
